    "In this lesson, we will look at how **Variance** of a random variable is used to calculate **Covariance** and **Correlation**, two key measures used in statistics for finding the relationships between random variables. These measures help us identify the degree to which two sets of data tend to deviate from their expected value (i.e. mean), in a similar way.  Based on these measures, we can see if two variables move together, and to what extent.  This lesson will help you develop a conceptual understanding, necessary calculations, and some precautions to keep in mind when using these measures. "

    "\n",
    "> __Variance is a measure used to quantify how much a random variable deviates from its mean value__. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate variance, we are essentially asking, \"__Given the relationship of all given data points, how distant from the mean do we expect the next data point to be?__\"  This \"distance\" is called the **error term**, and it's what variance measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is shown using notation $\\sigma^2$. Previously, we have seen $\\sigma$ as a measure of standard deviation. Remember, standard deviation is also a measure of the spread of data. __Variance is simply the square of standard deviation (Or we could say standard deviation is the square root of variance)__. "

    "For example, a simple application of this measure could be associating probabilities with predicted future events in a market research activity, identifying them as \"very likely\" or \"unlikely\" etc. Most people are risk averse, in that they wish to minimize the amount of risk they must endure to earn a certain level of expected return. If investors were indifferent to risk, they would not be influenced by the differences between stock A and stock B above, whereas the risk-averse investor would clearly prefer stock A. Therefore, most people want to know the range or dispersion(spread/deviation as we termed it earlier) of possible outcomes, as well as the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring. Variance measure is a great way to find all of the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range defined by the underlying data. \n",

    "Conglomo's distribution of returns is more concentrated than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively wider bell curve. A more concentrated distribution is defined as having a smaller standard deviation. The distribution curve appears higher, steeper, and narrower because more observations are occurring close to the expected return. Bilco's distribution is rather flat, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc."

    "If two variables have a correlation of +0.9,  this means the change in one item results in an almost similar change to another item. A correlation value of -0.9 means that the change is one variable results as an opposite change in the other variable. A Pearson correlation near 0 would be no effect. Here are some examples of Pearson correlation values as scatter plots. \n",

    "Think about stock markets in terms of correlation. Stock traders tend to use information about positive and negative correlations between prices of assets when building their portfolios.  All the stock market indexes tend to move together in similar directions. When the DOW Jones loses 5%, the S&P 500 usually loses around 5%. When the DOW Jones gains 5%, the S&P 500 usually gains around 5% because they are **highly correlated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there could also be negative correlation. You might observe that as the DOW Jones loses 5% of its value, gold might gain 5%. Alternatively, if the Dow Jones gains 5% of its value, gold may lose 5% of its value. That's **negative correlation**."

    "Are covariance and correlation the same thing? Simply put, no.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both covariance and correlation indicate whether variables are positively or inversely related to each other, they are not considered to be the same. This is because correlation also informs about the degree to which the variables tend to move together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is used to measure variables that have different units of measurement. By leveraging covariance, analysts can determine whether units are increasing or decreasing, but they can't say to what degree the variables are moving together since covariance does not use one standardized unit of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes the measure of interdependence between two variables and informs researchers as to how closely the two variables move together."

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lesson, we looked at calculating the variance of random variables as a measure of deviation from the mean. We saw how this measure can be used to first calculate covariance, and then correlation, to analyze how the change in one variable is associated with change in another variable. Next, we will see how we can use correlation analysis to run a __regression analysis__ and later, how covariance calculation helps us with dimensionality reduction."
